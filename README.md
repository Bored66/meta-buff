Description
============
This project intended to be in support of RPPS (Rapid Protocol Prototyping Solution - not publicly available yet).
Instead of defining protocol using XMl files it should be possible to define everything just by using certain set of classes and
very little code generation (thru variadic macros) while compiler should do the rest.

WARNING: 
--------------
This projects involves heavy use of meta-programming (templates and const expressions)!
